As mentioned in earlier feedback, I wasn't able to complete
most of the javascripting exercises because of instructions like this:

=========================================================

  Create a file named .  
   
  In that file, create a variable named .  
   
  Assign the string  to the variable .  
   
  Use  to print the length of the string to the terminal.

=========================================================
